## FullStack MERN Blog app.

- This app was made with React on the front-end and Node & Express on the backend, with MongoDB (Mongoose) for the data storage.
- In this project, I've practiced using Context API to share the information across the component tree.
- Users can register, and then they can start adding new articles (title, description and image).
- There's also categories filter that filters out the desired type of articles. 
- Users can edit and delete their posts.
